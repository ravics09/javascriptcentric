  <p>Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values. That&rsquo;s fine.<br>But quite often we find that we need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.</p>
  <p>It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can&rsquo;t insert a new property &ldquo;between&rdquo; the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.</p>

  <p>There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:</p>
  <p><code>let arr = new Array();</code><br><code>let arr = [];</code></p>
  <p>Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets</p>
